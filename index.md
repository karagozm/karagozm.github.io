## Welcome to Müge Karagöz's GitHub Web Page


### Hello

I am the Faculty Leader of the Simulating Particle Detection (SPD) research stream within the UMD FIRE undergraduate program where I have brought my expertise into my curriculum.
I aim to instill in my students an appreciation of curiosity-based basic science through the lens of computational and data analysis methods applied on cutting-edge particle physics experiments.
