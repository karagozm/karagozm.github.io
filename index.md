## Welcome to Müge Karagöz's GitHub Web Page


### Hello

I was the Faculty Leader of the Simulating Particle Detection (SPD) research group (stream) for four years within the UMD FIRE undergraduate program where I have brought my expertise into my curriculum.
I aim to instill in my students an appreciation of curiosity-based basic science through the lens of computational and data analysis and analytics methods applied on cutting-edge particle physics experiments.

This page will be filled with real content at some point. Meanwhile, please check out [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mugekaragoz/).

### UMD FIRE SPD Research Course

I had hope to place my resaarch training material in a repository for [SPD Course Material](https://github.com/karagozm/FIRE-SPD-Course-Resources), but it has been shelved indefinitely. Meanwhile, please see my personal UMD [web page](http://hepcms-hn.umd.edu/~karagozm/) (generously provided by UMD CMS group) for general highlights. My spring 2022 RA put together [the SPD page](https://firespd.wixsite.com/2022) with some more details. For more details of the range of SPD projects conducted, ranging from data visualization tools to ML applications to big data, please feel free to email me, as I may not be updating this section  anytime soon (or at all). 


### Acknowledgements

I thank UMD FIRE, UMD CMS, UMD Physics department, CMS Collaboration, and my students. I thank GitHub for their generosity with their support with GitHub Education.
