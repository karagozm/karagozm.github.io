## Welcome to Müge Karagöz's GitHub Web Page


### Hello

I was the Faculty Leader of the Simulating Particle Detection (SPD) research stream within the UMD FIRE undergraduate program where I have brought my expertise into my curriculum.
I aim to instill in my students an appreciation of curiosity-based basic science through the lens of computational and data analysis methods applied on cutting-edge particle physics experiments.

This page will be filled with real content at some point. Meanwhile, please check [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mugekaragoz/), UMD Physics directory [entry](https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/lecturers/item/1083-mkaragoz.html) and UMD FIRE [SPD](https://www.fire.umd.edu/spd) pages for more information.

### UMD FIRE SPD Course

Repository for [SPD Course Material](https://github.com/karagozm/FIRE-SPD-Course-Resources) is coming soon. Meanwhile, please see my personal UMD [web page](http://hepcms-hn.umd.edu/~karagozm/) (generously provided by UMD CMS group) for general highlights. My spring 2002 RA put together [the SPD page](https://firespd.wixsite.com/2022) with more details in spring 2022.


### Acknowledgements

I thank UMD FIRE, UMD CMS, UMD Physics department, and CMS Collaboration. I thank GitHub for their generosity with their support with GitHub Education.
